# Software Design Concepts

## Decomposing modern software application

- Models
- Views
- Controllers
- Jobs
- Mailers
- Helpers
- Services

## Kinds

- Object Oriented Programming (Ruby)
- Imperative Programming (C)
- Functionnal Programming (Haskell, Lisp, Clojure)
- Protocol Oriented Programming (Swift)

## Patterns

- Decorators: add functionnalities to object in specific context (avoid unnecessarily overloaded classes)
- Presenters: bridge between Model and View
- Observers: which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods

## Paradigms

- Pub/Sub (used for event IO cases)
- Reactive Functionnal Programming
